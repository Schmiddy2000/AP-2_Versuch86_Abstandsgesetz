# AP-2_Versuch86_Abstandsgesetz

This repository contains the python code used to analyse the data from our college projet on the inverse-square law for gamma radiators. For that we measure the detection rate with and without the radiation source.

## Notes when using juypter

1) Import all libraries from 'main.py'.
2) Copy all functions from functions.py into one box.
3) Copy the wanted data (from data1.py and/or data2.py) into another box. It's easier to use a separate box for each data set.
4) Remove 'f.' as a prefix from all function calls (that have this prefix).
5) Run the functions used to create the plots. This can be done in the same or in another box.

Additional notes:

- If the Chi_square function thows 'index out of range' errors, please widen the 'parameter_range'.
